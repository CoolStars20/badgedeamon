Dear {{name}},

We are looking forward to meeting you at Cool Stars 20 in Boston. Attached is a
draft version of your conference badge. On the badge, there is space for two
images that you can submit (one on the front and one on the back - see below
how to submit), e.g. an exciting image of a star forming region, a spectrum of
your favorite object, or a lightcurve of your new eclipsing L-dwarf binary
system.  We hope that this serves as a conversation starter during the meeting
("So, tell me what this plot means...").

You can also correct your name (e.g. missing special characters), affiliation
(e.g. to shorten the text to make it fit), or add a list of pronouns you want
people to use (e.g. if you identify with a non-binary gender [1]) To change
anything on your badge, just reply to this email without changing the subject
line **on or before July 26th**. Your email will be parsed by a program. If you need
to contact a human about your badge, write to hgunther@mit.edu.

TO CHANGE THE IMAGE, simply attach one or two jpeg, png, or pdf files to your
reply.

You can also edit your information below. Use LaTeX for markup, but don't
change the BADGE XXX part of the line or our automatic program won't be able to
parse the email.

BADGE PRONOUN: {{pronoun}}
(leave empty if you don't want to set a pronoun on the badge.)
BADGE NAME: {{name}}
BADGE AFFILIATION: {{affil}}

TO CHANGE THE IMAGE, simply attach one or two jpeg, png, or pdf files to your reply.

Our friendly bot will reply to you with a new badge and you can iterate until
you are happy. 

Please contact hgunther@mit.edu for assistance.

(If you are interested, the script for this bot is on github at
https://github.com/CoolStars20/badgedeamon .)

Yours,

Moritz
