Dear {{name}},

We are looking forward to meeting you at Cool Stars 20 in Boston. Attached is
a draft version of your conference badge. On the badge, there is space for one
image that you can submit (see below), e.g. an exciting image of a star forming
region, a spectrum of your favorite object, or a lightcurve of your new
eclipsing L-dwarf binary system.


We hope that this serves as a conversation starter during the meeting ("So,
tell me what this plot means...").

To change anything on your badge, just reply to this email without changing the
number in the subject line.

TO CORRECT YOUR NAME, put a line of text in your reply (unicode or LaTeX markup
should work) that starts with "REPLACE NAME: " like this:

REPLACE NAME: Mr. E. Xample

TO CORRECT YOUR AFFILIATION, put a line of text in your reply (unicode or
LaTeX markup should work) that starts with "REPLACE AFFILIATION:" like this:

REPLACE AFFILIATION: Institute of Example

TO CHANGE THE IMAGE, simply attach a jpeg, png, or pdf file to your reply.

Our friendly bot will reply to you with a new badge and you can iterate until
you are happy. 

Please contact hgunther@mit.edu for assistance.

(If you are interested, the script for this bot is on github at
https://github.com/CoolStars20/badgedeamon .)

Yours,

Moritz
